# Clean-and-Analyze-Data
### ðŸ§¹ Clean and Analyze This stage involved preparing the raw bank customer dataset for analysis and modeling. High-quality data is essential for reliable predictions, so the following steps were taken:
### ðŸ”§ Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicates and checked for missing values

- Encoded categorical features such as Gender and Geography

- caled numerical features like Balance, CreditScore, and Age for consistency

- Dropped irrelevant columns (e.g., CustomerId, Surname) that do not contribute to churn prediction

### DA)
- Visualized feature distributions using histograms and box plots

- Analyzed relationships between variables using correlation heatmaps

- Compared churn vs. non-churn groups to identify key differences in behavior

- Identified class imbalance in the target variable and considered resampling techniques

ðŸŽ¯ Key Insights
- Customers with fewer products, lower credit scores, or higher balances showed higher churn risk

- Geography and gender appeared to influence churn in some segments

- Tenure and active membership status were significant indicators of customer loyalty

- The cleaning and analysis phase provided a clear understanding of the datasetâ€™s structure and helped guide feature engineering and model selection.
